For example, this abbreviation:\n\n  ul#nav>li.item$*4>a{Item $}\n\n  ...can be expanded into:\n\n  <ul id=\"nav\">\n      <li class=\"item1\"><a href=\"\">Item 1</a></li>\n      <li class=\"item2\"><a href=\"\">Item 2</a></li>\n      <li class=\"item3\"><a href=\"\">Item 3</a></li>\n      <li class=\"item4\"><a href=\"\">Item 4</a></li>\n  </ul>\n\n  Read more about Emmet for Sublime Text:\n  https://github.com/emmetio/sublime-text-plugin#readme\n\nDebugger\n--------\n\n  For getting set up see https://github.com/daveleroy/sublime_debugger/blob/master/docs/setup.md\n  If you have issues or need help https://github.com/daveleroy/sublime_debugger\n\n  For a full list of changes see https://github.com/daveleroy/sublime_debugger/commits\n\n  Whats new in version 0.2.4\n  - Fixes rendering issue with variable values\n  - Adds missing mdpopups dependency \n\n  Whats new in version 0.2.3\n  - Updates path for lldb\n\n  Whats new in version 0.2.2\n  - Show dialog with error message when launching fails (to match vscode)\n  - In multi-threaded programs the reason for why a specific thread was stopped is now only displayed on that thread even if all threads were stopped\n  - If running a build with `sublime_build` in the configuration don't start debugging if the build fails with an exit code\n  - Fixes issue with pause not working\n  - Fixes rendering performance regression\n  - Fixes gutter icons on windows\n\n\n  Whats new in version 0.2.1\n  - Debugging with a single thread now just displays the stack frames without the thread header\n  - When launching a configuration and the adapter is not installed offer to install it\n  - When auto selecting a stack frame prefer the first none subtle stack frame\n  - Fixes call stack layout when encountering long stack frame names\n  - Fixes various issues with multi threaded debugging\n  - Fixes hover providers\n\n  Whats new in version 0.2.0\n  - Support for column breakpoints (requires adapter support)\n  - Support for data breakpoints (requires adapter support, currently only lldb?)\n  - Left-click gutter now toggles breakpoints, right-clicking a breakpoint allows editing/advanced options\n  - Watch expressions\n  - Loaded Modules/Sources panels\n  - Adds Node debug adapter (@appelgriebsch)\n  - External terminal support. Terminal on Mac (Needs support for Windows/Linux) or Sublime's Terminus package.\n  - Integrated terminal now strips ascii control sequences \n  - Settings button\n  - Show currently installed version of an adapter, show download progress when installing an adapter\n  - Fixes issues that sometimes occurred installing/reinstalling adapters\n  - Fixes issues with reloading plugin\n\n  Whats new in version 0.1.8\n  - Fixes core not defined error\n\n  Whats new in version 0.1.7\n  - Allow setting logging options in settings\n  - Updated url for vscode-firefox-debugger (@appelgriebsch)\n  - Fixes issue preventing Debugger: Install Adapters from being run from the command palette\n  - Fixes issue where some debug adapters were failing to be fully unzipped on Windows because of long paths\n\n  Whats new in version 0.1.6\n  - Adds run to cursor command\n  - Fixes issue preventing installing debug adapters\n\n  Whats new in version 0.1.5\n  - Fixes issue that prevented debugging on windows\n\n  Whats new in version 0.1.4\n  - New styling of panels and updated layout to better support temporary panels created for build results/integrated terminal (and in the future allow customizing the layout of the panels)\n  - New console rendering code to support text wrapping and build results/integrated terminal\n  - Support internal terminal requests to allow program input. Requires configuration changes to use this feature which depends on the adapter in question. (LLVM uses \"terminal\": \"integrated\")\n  - Allow defining platform specific configuration settings with a top level object called \"linux\", \"osx\", or \"windows\" in your configuration. Same as vscode \n  - Fixes issue where hover providers/autocomplete/run command was not working for some debug adapters \n  - Fixes issue where using $file and other variables in a configuration had their values expanded when the debugger was opened not when the debugger was started\n  - Fixes some wonkiness that occurred when stepping the debugger that caused it to not update correctly\n\n  Whats new in version 0.1.3\n  - When attempting to open the debugger in a window without a sublime project prompt the user to create one.\n  - Fixes some other minor bugs and configuration issues\n\n  Whats new in version 0.1.0\n  - Adds package control support\n\nDebugger\n--------\n\n  For getting set up see https://github.com/daveleroy/sublime_debugger/blob/master/docs/setup.md\n  If you have issues or need help https://github.com/daveleroy/sublime_debugger\n\n  For a full list of changes see https://github.com/daveleroy/sublime_debugger/commits\n\n  Whats new in version 0.2.4\n  - Fixes rendering issue with variable values\n  - Adds missing mdpopups dependency \n\n  Whats new in version 0.2.3\n  - Updates path for lldb\n\n  Whats new in version 0.2.2\n  - Show dialog with error message when launching fails (to match vscode)\n  - In multi-threaded programs the reason for why a specific thread was stopped is now only displayed on that thread even if all threads were stopped\n  - If running a build with `sublime_build` in the configuration don't start debugging if the build fails with an exit code\n  - Fixes issue with pause not working\n  - Fixes rendering performance regression\n  - Fixes gutter icons on windows\n\n\n  Whats new in version 0.2.1\n  - Debugging with a single thread now just displays the stack frames without the thread header\n  - When launching a configuration and the adapter is not installed offer to install it\n  - When auto selecting a stack frame prefer the first none subtle stack frame\n  - Fixes call stack layout when encountering long stack frame names\n  - Fixes various issues with multi threaded debugging\n  - Fixes hover providers\n\n  Whats new in version 0.2.0\n  - Support for column breakpoints (requires adapter support)\n  - Support for data breakpoints (requires adapter support, currently only lldb?)\n  - Left-click gutter now toggles breakpoints, right-clicking a breakpoint allows editing/advanced options\n  - Watch expressions\n  - Loaded Modules/Sources panels\n  - Adds Node debug adapter (@appelgriebsch)\n  - External terminal support.
